# awax_project
This is a Web template (architecture only) of a project called Awax from the web. 
It is just a copy of the original project, it is not an original one made by me. Unfortunately I do not know the name of the creator to give credits, but it was truly challenging and I have learned a lot from it.

This template was an exercise project that we built along with the instructor, Bonieky Lacerda, in one of his classes about HTML / CSS, using Flexbox. 
The main idea was to copy the project with its details and features, but with the architecture only (Javascript was not used in this particular exercise). And also apply a responsive design in it.
